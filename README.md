# Continuous Integration Server

Create and provision a Continuous Integration server on DigitalOcean using Docker, Terraform, Ansible, Nginx and Jenkins.

## Prerequisites

You'll need the following things before you get started:

#### Docker

To install Docker, follow the installation guide: [https://docs.docker.com/install/](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

#### DigitalOcean account

[Sign up](https://m.do.co/c/344de7bea76b) for a DigitalOcean account

#### DigitalOcean Personal Access Token

Once you have a DigitalOcean account you can create a Personal Access Token by following this guide in their API docs: https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/api/create-personal-access-token/

## Getting Started

1. To start, run the following commands to get set up:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:samwrigley/continuous-integration.git
cd continuous-integration
```

2. Build the `ci` Docker image from the `Dockerfile` by running the following command from the root the project. Make sure to replace `<ssh-email>` with your own email.

```sh
docker build \
    --build-arg SSH_EMAIL=<ssh-email> \
    --tag ci .
```

3. Create a container from the Docker image using the follow command, again from the root of the project. Make sure to replace `<digitalocean-token>` with your DigitalOcean token.

```sh
docker run -it \
    --name ci \
    --restart=unless-stopped \
    --env DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN=<digitalocean-token> \
    ci
```

4. To create and provision your Continuous Integration server on DigitalOcean, simply run the `server.sh` script inside the `ci` container. Please note that the `server.sh` script only need to be run once, although no harm will come from running it multiple times.

From outside the container:

```sh
docker exec -it ci /bin/sh server.sh
```

From inside the container:

```sh
/server.sh
```

Once the script has finished running, your Continuous Integration server is up and running at the IP address listed in the output ðŸš€:

```sh
ip = xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
```

Jenkins is now up and running on your server at `https://<server-ip>`. Before Jenkins is ready to use, you'll need to complete the 'Getting Started' steps. Simply follow the instructions at `https://<server-ip>` to finish the set up process. Once completed, you can continue to access Jenkins from the same URL.

If you wish to use a custom domain name to access Jenkins rather than the server's IP address, simply update your DNS records and create an A record pointing `ci.example.com` to `<server-ip>`.
